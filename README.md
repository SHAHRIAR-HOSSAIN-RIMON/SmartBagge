# ‚úàÔ∏è Luggage Tracking System (SQL-Based Project)

## Overview

Airline passengers often face **lost, delayed, or mismanaged luggage** during check-in, transfer, or arrival. This project creates a **database-driven Luggage Tracking System** that helps airlines **track, monitor, and manage luggage efficiently**.

The system keeps each luggage item **linked to a passenger, a flight, and its current location**, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## System Flow

1.  Passenger creates booking for a specific flight.
2.  Passenger checks in ‚Üí luggage registered and linked to booking.
3.  Luggage assigned initial location (check-in counter).
4.  During transit, system updates luggage location (via `Baggage_Status` table).
5.  If luggage delayed/lost ‚Üí record created in `Reports` table.
6.  Employees review and resolve reports.

```

### Show All Passengers and Their Luggage Count

```sql
SELECT
    p.passenger_id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    COUNT(l.luggage_id) AS total_luggage

## üöÄ Future Vision & Roadmap

We aim to transform this SQL-based **Luggage Tracking System** into a fully integrated, real-time airline management solution.  
The roadmap below outlines our **phased development plan** from academic prototype to national-level deployment.

### üè¢ Phase 1 ‚Äî Integration with National Flights
- Collaborate with **domestic airlines and airports** to pilot the system using real flight and passenger data.  
- Assign every bag a **unique digital Luggage ID** for scanning and tracking across all checkpoints.  
- Integrate directly with **check-in counters, security zones, and baggage belts** through connected terminals and scanners.

### üì° Phase 3 ‚Äî Real-Time Smart Tracking (IoT Integration)
- Develop **IoT-enabled luggage tags** using RFID + GPS sensors.  
- Provide passengers and staff a **live-tracking dashboard** (web + mobile).  
- Send **automated alerts** on status changes ‚Äî *arrived*, *delayed*, *misrouted*, etc.

### üåç Phase 2 ‚Äî International Expansion
- Extend coverage to **partner airports worldwide** for cross-border luggage tracking.  
- Add **multi-language** and **multi-timezone** support for international operations.  
- Sync with **Airline Management Systems (AMS)** and **customs databases** to prevent lost or misrouted baggage.


### ü§ñ Phase 4 ‚Äî Predictive Analytics & AI Assistance
- Implement **machine-learning models** to predict potential baggage delays or losses based on flight patterns and weather.  
- Use AI insights to help airlines **optimize luggage flow** and **reduce mishandling incidents**.



### üß© Phase 5 ‚Äî Passenger Portal & Mobile Access
- Launch a secure **public web/mobile portal** where passengers can:
  - Track luggage status in real time  
  - View last scanned location  
  - File or view reports on lost/delayed baggage  
  - Chat with airline representatives
 
### ü™™ Phase 6 ‚Äî National Aviation Database Integration
- Partner with **civil aviation authorities** to link the system with national **air traffic and passenger databases**.  
- Establish a **centralized Luggage Identity System** accessible by all airports and airlines in real time.

---
### üåü Vision Statement
> ‚ÄúTo make air travel stress-free by ensuring **every bag has a digital identity ‚Äî traceable, transparent, and always accounted for.**‚Äù
