# ✈️ Luggage Tracking System (SQL-Based Project)

## 🧩 Overview

Airline passengers often face **lost, delayed, or mismanaged luggage** during check-in, transfer, or arrival. This project creates a **database-driven Luggage Tracking System** that helps airlines **track, monitor, and manage luggage efficiently**.

The system keeps each luggage item **linked to a passenger, a flight, and its current location**, ensuring transparency and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Maintain accurate luggage data — weight, type, and status.
* Link luggage with **specific passengers and flights**.
* Track luggage journey from **check-in → transit → arrival**.
* Alert on lost, delayed, or misplaced baggage.
* Generate **reports** for operational analysis.

---

## 📊 Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

**Key Relationships:**

* Each passenger can have **multiple luggage items**.
* Each luggage belongs to **one flight** and is at **one location**.
* Each luggage can have **many status updates** (history tracking).
* Employees handle **reports** for lost/delayed luggage.

## 🔁 System Flow

1. ✈️ Passenger checks in → luggage registered in database.
2. 🎫 Luggage assigned to a flight and initial location (check-in counter).
3. 📡 During transit, system updates luggage location (via `Baggage_Status` table).
4. 🧾 If luggage delayed/lost → record created in `Reports` table.
5. 👨‍💼 Employees review and resolve reports.

## 🧱 Database Schema Design (SQL)

### 1. Airport_Locations Table
**Create this FIRST** (other tables reference it)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Airport_Locations (
    location_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    airport_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    location_name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### 2. Flights Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Flights (
    flight_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    flight_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    departure_airport_id INT,
    arrival_airport_id INT,
    departure_time DATETIME,
    arrival_time DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (departure_airport_id) REFERENCES Airport_Locations(location_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (arrival_airport_id) REFERENCES Airport_Locations(location_id)
);
```

### 3. Passengers Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Passengers (
    passenger_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    passport_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);
```

### 4. Luggage Table
**KEY FIX:** Added `current_location_id` to track where luggage is NOW

```sql
CREATE TABLE Luggage (
    luggage_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    passenger_id INT,
    flight_id INT,
    weight DECIMAL(5,2),
    type VARCHAR(50), -- 'carry-on' or 'checked-in'
    status VARCHAR(50), -- 'checked in', 'in transit', 'arrived', 'lost'
    current_location_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (passenger_id) REFERENCES Passengers(passenger_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (flight_id) REFERENCES Flights(flight_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (current_location_id) REFERENCES Airport_Locations(location_id)
);
```

### 5. Baggage_Status Table
**Tracks movement history of luggage**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Baggage_Status (
    status_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    luggage_id INT,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp DATETIME,
    location_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (luggage_id) REFERENCES Luggage(luggage_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES Airport_Locations(location_id)
);
```

### 6. Employees Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    role VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);
```

### 7. Reports Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Reports (
    report_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    luggage_id INT,
    report_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'lost', 'delayed', 'damaged'
    description TEXT,
    report_time DATETIME,
    status VARCHAR(50), -- 'resolved', 'pending'
    employee_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (luggage_id) REFERENCES Luggage(luggage_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employees(employee_id)
);
```

## ⚙️ Example SQL Queries

### Step 1: Insert Airport Locations

```sql
INSERT INTO Airport_Locations (location_id, airport_code, location_name, city, country)
VALUES 
(1, 'DAC', 'Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport', 'Dhaka', 'Bangladesh'),
(2, 'FCO', 'Leonardo da Vinci International Airport', 'Rome', 'Italy'),
(3, 'DXB', 'Dubai International Airport', 'Dubai', 'UAE');
```

### Step 2: Insert Flight

```sql
INSERT INTO Flights (flight_id, flight_number, departure_airport_id, arrival_airport_id, departure_time, arrival_time)
VALUES (101, 'BG201', 1, 2, '2025-10-15 09:00:00', '2025-10-15 15:30:00');
```

### Step 3: Insert Passenger

```sql
INSERT INTO Passengers (passenger_id, first_name, last_name, passport_number, email, phone_number)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'A12345678', 'john.doe@example.com', '01712345678');
```

### Step 4: Register Luggage (with current location)

```sql
INSERT INTO Luggage (luggage_id, passenger_id, flight_id, weight, type, status, current_location_id)
VALUES (1, 1, 101, 22.5, 'checked-in', 'checked in', 1);
```

### Step 5: Track Luggage Movement (Add to history)

```sql
-- Luggage checked in at Dhaka
INSERT INTO Baggage_Status (luggage_id, status, timestamp, location_id)
VALUES (1, 'checked in', NOW(), 1);

-- Luggage arrives at Dubai (transit)
INSERT INTO Baggage_Status (luggage_id, status, timestamp, location_id)
VALUES (1, 'in transit', NOW(), 3);

-- Update current location in Luggage table
UPDATE Luggage SET current_location_id = 3, status = 'in transit' WHERE luggage_id = 1;
```

### Step 6: Report Lost Luggage

```sql
INSERT INTO Reports (luggage_id, report_type, description, report_time, status, employee_id)
VALUES (1, 'lost', 'Luggage did not arrive at Rome Airport.', NOW(), 'pending', 2);

UPDATE Luggage SET status = 'lost' WHERE luggage_id = 1;
```

SELECT 
    r.report_id,
    r.report_type,
    r.description,
    p.first_name,
