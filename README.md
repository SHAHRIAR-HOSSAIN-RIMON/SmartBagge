# ✈️ Luggage Tracking System (SQL-Based Project)

## Overview

Airline passengers often face **lost, delayed, or mismanaged luggage** during check-in, transfer, or arrival. This project creates a **database-driven Luggage Tracking System** that helps airlines **track, monitor, and manage luggage efficiently**.

The system keeps each luggage item **linked to a passenger, a flight, and its current location**, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## System Flow

1.  Passenger creates booking for a specific flight.
2.  Passenger checks in → luggage registered and linked to booking.
3.  Luggage assigned initial location (check-in counter).
4.  During transit, system updates luggage location (via `Baggage_Status` table).
5.  If luggage delayed/lost → record created in `Reports` table.
6.  Employees review and resolve reports.

## Database Schema Design (SQL)

Ah! Now I fully understand 😤 — you want **all sections properly formatted with `##` and `###` headings** like a GitHub README, **not just one `##` at the top**, so it looks like the documentation, but only the SQL codes under each section. Got it. I’ll rewrite the entire thing cleanly in **Markdown + SQL** format for direct pasting.

Here’s the fixed version:

````markdown

## 🚀 Future Vision & Roadmap

We aim to transform this SQL-based **Luggage Tracking System** into a fully integrated, real-time airline management solution.  
The roadmap below outlines our **phased development plan** from academic prototype to national-level deployment.

### 🏢 Phase 1 — Integration with National Flights
- Collaborate with **domestic airlines and airports** to pilot the system using real flight and passenger data.  
- Assign every bag a **unique digital Luggage ID** for scanning and tracking across all checkpoints.  
- Integrate directly with **check-in counters, security zones, and baggage belts** through connected terminals and scanners.

### 📡 Phase 3 — Real-Time Smart Tracking (IoT Integration)
- Develop **IoT-enabled luggage tags** using RFID + GPS sensors.  
- Provide passengers and staff a **live-tracking dashboard** (web + mobile).  
- Send **automated alerts** on status changes — *arrived*, *delayed*, *misrouted*, etc.

### 🌍 Phase 2 — International Expansion
- Extend coverage to **partner airports worldwide** for cross-border luggage tracking.  
- Add **multi-language** and **multi-timezone** support for international operations.  
- Sync with **Airline Management Systems (AMS)** and **customs databases** to prevent lost or misrouted baggage.


### 🤖 Phase 4 — Predictive Analytics & AI Assistance
- Implement **machine-learning models** to predict potential baggage delays or losses based on flight patterns and weather.  
- Use AI insights to help airlines **optimize luggage flow** and **reduce mishandling incidents**.



### 🧩 Phase 5 — Passenger Portal & Mobile Access
- Launch a secure **public web/mobile portal** where passengers can:
  - Track luggage status in real time  
  - View last scanned location  
  - File or view reports on lost/delayed baggage  
  - Chat with airline representatives
 
### 🪪 Phase 6 — National Aviation Database Integration
- Partner with **civil aviation authorities** to link the system with national **air traffic and passenger databases**.  
- Establish a **centralized Luggage Identity System** accessible by all airports and airlines in real time.

### 🌟 Vision Statement
> “To make air travel stress-free by ensuring **every bag has a digital identity — traceable, transparent, and always accounted for.**”
